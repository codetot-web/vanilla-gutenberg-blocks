# Vanilla Gutenberg Blocks

Craft Gutenberg blocks is not easy if you don't use Webpack or any Javascript. We know it's required skill to do that, however sometimes we just need a great layout with content, such as normal landing pages. This repository contains some of best blocks we made, with or without plugins.

## Available Blocks

- Hero Homepage
